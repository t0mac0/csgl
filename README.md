##DREAMBOAT
  Generic library for C

##DESCRIPTION
  I am a lover of C language, for its simplicity, for its performance.
But when compared with some modern language, C is too crude in many respects.  
1. no container api, like list, dictionary, set and many others.  
   # The basic three containers must be implement, list, dict, set.  
   # Other containers should put into consideration.  
2. no concurrency data structure for multi-core application.   
   # multi-producer multi-consumer queue must be implement.   
3. crude string api  
4. no simple way to write async code, no coroutine, no state machine, no async-await.  
5. too many boring work when you write network application  
6. its hard to cooperate with database.  
7. no standard way to deal json, xml

##ROADMAP
  I don't wanna dicuss why not choose a modern language. I just wanna make us easy to write C program.
A project must have a roadmap and the roadmap is:   
  1->2->3->4->5->6->7   
  The current step is 1.


##RELATED WORK
  There is many great work before this project, and we must have our respect for them.
